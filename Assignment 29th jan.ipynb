    "Q1= Who developed python programming language?\n",
    "Ans= Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on 20 February 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2= Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "Ans= Python support object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3= Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans3= Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4= What is the correct extension of the python file?\n",
    "Ans4= The correct extension for Python source code files is “ .py ”\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5= Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans5= Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language,\n",
    "    which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and then interpreted line by line. \n",
    "    The compile part gets deleted as soon as the code gets executed in Python so that the programmer does not get onto unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6= Name a few blocks of a code used to define in python language?\n",
    "Ans6= Module, Function ,Conditional Statements, Loops.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Q14= How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Ans14= The Python memory is primarily managed by Python private heap space.\n",
    "       All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. \n",
    "       The programmer does not have access to this private heap and interpreter takes care of this Python private heap.\n",
